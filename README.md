Welcome to BitTales, an app designed for parents, children, and older adults to enjoy stories together! BitTales is a fun and engaging way for parents to tell stories to their children in their own voices, creating a unique and memorable experience for the whole family. It's also a platform for older adults to share their knowledge and stories with the next generation.

## Features
- Voice setup: Parents can set up their voice and provide a sample recording to be used in the storytelling.

- Story library: Browse a library of classic and original stories that are perfect for kids of all ages. These stories are curated from various books and knowledge learned from seniors and old age people (after obtaining consent from all parties involved).

- Interactive storytelling: Engage your child with interactive elements in each story, including sound effects and animations.

- Personalization: Add your child's name to the story to make it more personal and special.

- Learning from seniors: Older adults can use the app as an AI companion to talk to and share their stories and knowledge. These stories will be checked for toxicity before being added to our knowledge base.


## Usage
Using BitTales is easy and fun! Once you have access, parents can set up their voice, browse the story library, and select a story that they would like to tell. Children can listen to the story with interactive elements that will keep them engaged and excited. Older adults can use the app as an AI companion to talk to and share their stories and knowledge, helping to pass down important knowledge to the next generation.
